### Usage:
1. run the command `go run main.go` - this uses the `images` directory by default which should be located in the current working directory. It generates both CSV and HTML files by default.
2. to use another directory, run `go run main.go -path=<path to directory>`
3. to specify the output format (CSV or HTML), run `go run main.go -csv` or `go run main.go -html`
